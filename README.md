# Guess_it
<p>I have been practicing my front-end web development. During this time I have created to this little fun game.
In this game player is supposed to guess a correct number between given range. If the number matches the number generated by the computer, user wins the game, and the score is calculated according to the number of tries he/she took to guess the correct number.</p>
